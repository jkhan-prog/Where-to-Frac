# Where-to-Frac?

This project analyzes the well log data with the essential measurements acquired by a logging tool. The aim is to carry out Rock type analysis using these input measurements. The rock type determines the probability of finding the Hydrocarbon reservior(Oil and Gas) in those formations and help decide where in the cased hole to perform Fracturing(Frac) operation. The data however is not clean and needs to be looked at before jumping into any analysis.

We will use K-Means Unsupervised Machine Learning model to determine the clusters of rock formations. From these clusters of Rock formations we will find the target rock with hydrocarbon reservior to perform Frac operations on.

Notebook is divided into following sections:
Step 1: Answering the question/n
Step 2: Checking the data
Step 3: Tidying the data
Step 4: Rock Type Analysis
Step 5: Conclusions and Future Work
